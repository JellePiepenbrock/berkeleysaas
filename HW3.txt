I'm going to be honest here: I thought this was hard to get working correctly! It looked so easy, when I scanned the assigments, to get an estimate of how much time I would need to spend. 
I was wrong, this took me much longer than I anticipated: I asked a friend of mine to look it over, because certain errors were driving me up the wall (where did that space/comma/apostrophe come from
and why does it break everything?).

In the end, it all worked out though. Didn't get the perfect score this time, maybe I'll have some more time to iron out the last few errors this weekend.
