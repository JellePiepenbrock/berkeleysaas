I had some problems getting the autotest to work, but switching to another workspace helped resolve the problem (I still don't know why.) This assignment was a bit easier than I had expected, from memory
I found the last assignment (from CS169.1x) to be more difficult. All in all, this was useful for learning to interface with an external service (even though I am still not sure about XML, I should read more about Xpath, seems interesting).
Going to start revising the book for the midterm now.
