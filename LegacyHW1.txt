This assignment was fun! (As soon as I knew how to fix the bug..) This really made me realize what the benefit of such an organised structure as Rails is. As soon as you see the error message, 
you can think: 'Oh, this is probably due to a problem in this controller action here..' and then you still have to figure out how to fix the bug, but half the work is already behind you. 

This also made me realize that writing tests is hard. I'll get there eventually.
